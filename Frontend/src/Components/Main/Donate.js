                    <p  className="my-5 font-semibold text-orange">Corpus Donation</p>
                    <p className="my-5">Donating to a Corpus Fund is one way to build up a strong organisation. Funds in a Corpus cannot be used directly at any time- the organisation is supposed to use only the interest accruing from the investment made out of the Corpus donations, without touching the principal itself. This way your money remains forever, strengthening the organization.</p>
                    
                    <p  className="my-5 font-semibold text-orange">General Donation</p>
                    <p className="my-5">Make a general donation and we will assign the funds to the area where we know the need is greatest. Your donation helps to make a difference in the lives of children, giving them a new hope, proper education and health care-in short giving them the chances in life they deserve to emerge as 'Eternal Winners'.</p>
