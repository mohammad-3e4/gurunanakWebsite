                    <p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>Sarbhat dah phalla or Sarbat da bhala is a Punjabi term which means "may everyone be blessed"or "may good come to all". This is a term from an important part of the Sikh prayer called the Ardas. This term forms an important part of Sikh philosophy. The term establishes a new precedence set by the Sikh Gurus - It binds the Sikh to ask for the "well being of everyone in the world". In establishing this concept, the Gurus have set a new standard for the Sikhs – not only should the Sikhs pray for their own well-being but also need to ask for the blessing of "all the peoples of the world".
                        <br></br><br></br>
                        All Sikhs narrate this prayer called the Ardas (final request/prayer to God) at least twice a day. In the ardas, the Sikhs say the following line near the end of the Ardas:-</p><br></br>

                        <li><CheckBadgeIcon className="h-6 w-6 inline text-blue" /> "Nanak Naam Chardikala, teraa bhanaa Sarbaht dah Phahla" which can be translated as "Nanak asks for 'Naam' (name of God) with which comes well being, happiness and positive spirit and with your blessings, Lord may everyone in the world prosper and be in peace" or can be broken down as:</li>
                        <li> <CheckBadgeIcon className="h-6 w-6 inline text-blue" /> Nanak, With Naam comes Chardi Kala and with your blessings, may there be peace for all (part of the Ardas performed daily by all practising Sikhs)</li>
                    </ul><br></br>
                    <p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }} >
                        The Sikh concept of "Sarbaht dah Phahla" which means "blessings for everyone" or literally "May everyone Prosper".
                        <br></br><br></br>
                        This statement is repeated by all practising Sikhs at least twice daily (if not more) as part of their Nitnem (daily prayers). This concept is central to Sikhism and forms a very important and essential role in the religious philosophy of the Sikh Gurus.
                        <br></br><br></br>
                        To put this in concise and clear language, it means that the Sikh desires, prays and asks God for the:

                        A true Sikh selflessly prays daily for "all to prosper". This gesture comes from the clear and pure teaching of Gurbani (Sri Guru Granth Sahib, SGGS) and forms the Gurmat code of conduct. Gurbani tells us that there are no "others". There is only One. The same One God resides within all. We are all the children of that One God. As the potter makes pots of different forms and colors from the same basic clay; and as the goldsmith moulds jewellery of various types, colors are all born of the and shapes from the same single homogenous material, gold; similarly, we same One Light. There is no difference.
